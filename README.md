We will add to this repository some numerical data for our GECCO 2019 paper: 
[Doerr, Doerr, Lengler: Self-Adjusting Mutation Rates with Provably Optimal Success Rules]

If you are curious, and can't wait to see it, please just contact us by e-mail and we will be happy to send you the data. Otherwise, please be patient. Everything should be uploaded by the end of May 2019.
